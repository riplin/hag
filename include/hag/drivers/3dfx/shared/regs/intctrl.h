// The intrCtrl register controls the interrupt capabilities of Banshee. Bits 1:0 enable video horizontal sync
// signal generation of interrupts. Generated horizontal sync interrupts are detected by the CPU by reading
// bits 7:6 of intrCtrl. Bits 3:2 enable video vertical sync signal generation of interrupts. Generated vertical
// sync interrupts are detected by the CPU by reading bits 9:8 of intrCtrl. Bit 4 of intrCtrl enables
// generation of interrupts when the frontend PCI FIFO is full. Generated PCI FIFO Full interrupts are
// detected by the CPU by reading bit 10 of intrCtrl. PCI FIFO full interrupts are genered when intrCtrl bit
// 4 is set and the number of free entries in the frontend PCI FIFO drops below the value specified in
// fbiInit0 bits(10:6). Bit 5 of intrCtrl enables the user interrupt command USERINTERRUPT generation
// of interrupts. Generated user interrupts are detected by the CPU by reading bit 11 of intrCtrl. The tag
// associated with a generated user interrupt is stored in bits 19:12 of intrCtrl.
// Generated interrupts are cleared by writing a 0 to the bit signaling a particular interrupt was generated
// and writing a 1 to interCtrl bit(31). For example, a PCI FIFO full generated interrupt is cleared by
// writing a 0 to bit 10 of intrCtrl, and a generated user interrupt is cleared by writing a 0 to bit 11 of
// intrCtrl. For both cases, bit 31 of intrCtrl must be written with the value 1 to clear the external PCI
// interrupt. Care must be taken when clearing interrupts not to accidentally overwrite the interrupt mask
// bits (bits 5:0) of intrCtrl) which enable generation of particular interrupts.
// Note that writes to the intrCtrl register are not pushed on the PCI frontend FIFO, so writes to intrCtrl
// are processed immediately. Since intrCtrl is not FIFOâ€™ed, writes to intrCtrl may be processed out-of-
// order with respect to other queued writes in the PCI and memory-backed FIFOs.
