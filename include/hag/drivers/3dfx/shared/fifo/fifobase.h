// Banshee supports two full CMDFIFO streams and each individually can be located in frame buffer
// memory or AGP space. Each CMDFIFO has its own base address register set, that defines the starting
// address, memory space, and size of the CMDFIFO. The CMDFIFO registers contain a write only bump
// register that increments the write pointer by the amount written to the cmdBump register. Each
// CMDFIFO contains a read pointer, write pointer, and freespace count of the fifo itself, so the CPU can
// monitor the progress and fullness of the CMDFIFO. Ordering between the two CMDFIFOâ€™s is first come,
// first served.

// X = written location     O = unwritten location

// The command registers define the location, size, and fifo management method of the command fifo. The
// command fifo starts at the address defined in the cmdBaseAddr[01] register and occupies N 4k byte
// pages defined in the cmdBaseSize register. The command fifo can be located either in AGP or frame
// buffer memory which is defined in the cmdBaseSize register. CmdRdPtr points to the last executed
// entry in the command fifo. Amin is a pointer that walks through the fifo until it reaches an unwritten
// location. The rdptr can not access any entry beyond the amin pointer. The amax pointer is set to the
// furthest address location of a given write. The hole counter is basically the number of unwritten locations
// between the amax register and the amin register. When the hole counter is zero, the amin register is set to
// the value of the amax register, thus allowing the read pointer to advance to the new amin register value.
// The depth of the fifo is calculated by the difference between amax and rdptr.

// Or, put another way (from the perspective of a driver writer):

// When hole counting is enabled (hardware manages command fifo depth), the memory controller takes
// special action whenever a write occurs between the command fifo base and the base + size. As writes
// occur in this region, five variables are fiddled: readPtr, depth, aMin, aMax, and holeCount. As ordered
// writes happen, both aMin and aMax increment, as does depth and readPtr. In this state, the difference
// between aMin/aMax and the readPtr is the depth. When the depth is nonzero, the readPtr advances as
// commands are read from the buffer. When/if an out-of-order write occurs, aMin stops incrementing, but
// aMax continues to increment as addresses written go up. The readPtr will not pass aMin, so the depth
// begins to decrement. Once the readPtr has caught up with aMin, the depth sits at zero. If aMax ever has
// to skip (due to an out-of-order write), the hole count is incremented. As out-of-order data gets written
// between aMin and aMax, the hole count is decremented. When the holeCount goes to zero, the difference
// between aMin and aMax is added to the depth, and aMin is set to be the same as aMax. This causes
// command processing to resume.
